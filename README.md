# Date-File-Sorter
Sorts large amount of date-time stamped files into folders.

# DESCRIPTION: 
  A folder contains several date-time stamped files in the format of:
              2015-12-10-17-15-56.jpg
   This program will look into the folder, seperate each collection of files by year, month, and day and automatically create new sets of folders to contain each of them.  No empty folders will be created.  Any additional  files created where a folder already exists will be added to the existing folder.

#  Note: 
This is a nice sorting program which can be used for photos or logs which are created every X seconds and automatically sort them.

# Execution: 
  python2 FileSorter.py
